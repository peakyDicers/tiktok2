WITHOUT WARNING, 
vim will add a new line to the end of your file. 

touch foo
wc -l foo # this will show zero lines. that's cool. 

# now, vim foo, write some text. backspace it all. write to file.
wc -l foo # this will now show one line. 

what's most infurating is, when you vim foo, vim
doesn't show you the new line at the end of the file. 

it just magically adds it when you write to the file. 

???? don't touch my fking file wtf?

what's even more stupid is, if i already have a new line
at the end of file, it adds another one. like. 

i gotta make sure to not add a new line while writing
this now, so that i only have ONE new line at EOF.
